*How to: Add a Language*
============================

Adding more languages to "hextris" is very simple and fast.
You just need to follow these steps:

1) Copy the "en-US.js" file and rename it to your languages name.
e.g. if your are translating to chinese, just use "zh-CN". And please use always the language code with 5 chars!
See here for a full list of languages: [http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm]

2) Replace the "____LanguageServerResourcesEN_US" to your language, e.g. "____LanguageServerResourcesZH_CN".

3) Translate the content

4) Add a reference to the language in "Language-server.js" and in the "index.html" file.
